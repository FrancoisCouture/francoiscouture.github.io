        My name is Francois Couture and I am proud to present to you my webpage! <br>
        I am a NSCC graduate in Computer Electronics and I have worked as a technician for the province of Nova Scotia.
        Currently, I am enrolled at Saint Mary's University set to major in <i>Computing Science and Business Administration</i>, graduating in 2023.<br>
        At the top of the site, you will find navigation widgets that will lead you to other pages about my skills, education and experience. This website also contains information about itself! I explain in brief how the website works and how the source code influence the pages. <strong>Everything I provide is free to use for anyone</strong>.<br><br>
        Scrolling down will hide the navigation bar. You can bring it back into view by clicking on the dropdown arrow or by returning to the top of the page.<br><br>
        To reach me, please click the blue "Contact me" button at the top of the webpage.<br><br>
        

      </p>
      <p>
        This website is supposed to represent who I am and what I do in the most interactive way possible. As of now, it only contains the few things I am capable of. As I grow older and more experienced, I want the website to grow alongside me by carrying more experiences and more skills.
        It becomes both a portfolio and a living diary. My dream is to make this place elaborate, intricate. It will carry HTML5 games I create for fun. It will host my videos that I want to share with the world. There will be pictures about what I was able to accomplish. More navigation buttons to better express who I am.
        I want it to encapsulate my life so that anyone seeing this can get to know me and witness how I grew as a person.<br> I am not perfect, but I try every day to get better. That's why I'm presenting my page and why I'm thanking you for being part of the journey.
