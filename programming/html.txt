        <p>Coming up with the idea of the website, I wanted it to have a few key traits. It should be thiner than the  
          window, have drop down navigation bar and a low-profile body. Originally, there was supposed to be a solid
          content body, but it was changed as it was too obtrusive. The concept was recycled to use shades, which
          works great with the depth "feel" I'm going for.<br> 
          In addition, there is a main division that encapsulates the heads and contents not present in the sketch.</p>
        <p>The project began with the header. I use invisible drop-down navigation options that only become visible
           when the user decides to hover over the buttons. The active becomes shaded, and I use javascript to
           time the shading of the submenus. Easy!</p>
        <p>I eventually had the idea of hiding the header bar as the user scrolled down. By hiding the bar, it would leave
           the user with more space to see the website. When the user scrolls down, the code is triggered to raise the bar
           "outside" of the browser. When scroll bar is at the top, it comes back into view. Neat!<br>
           A little image of an arrow pointing down also becomes visible, indicating that, at any time, the user can decide
           to lower the bar down without having to scroll back up.</p>
        <p>To promote my stuff, I used folder tabs and bodies. That way, I can use less web pages and flex some javascript 
           muscle.</p>

        <img src="../img/html-h-img2.png" alt="img2">
        <p>In the body section, some elements are set to default values. I removed the margins, the default font is 
           Arial and sans-serif in black unless otherwise stated. Right now, all of the pages use their own version
           of headers and footers. I should change that so that there's only one file of headers and footers that each
           page will use instead of the current repetition. It would make editing a lot easier, but I'm worried about
           potential conflicts.</p>
        <p>For starters, I had to make sure the header bar was well above the rest of the page. It is hard-coded to
           9, making it the most elevated object on the webpage. If at any point the user should desire to drop down 
           the header, it will always be above the other contents on the page.</p>
        <p>I had initially wanted an opacity transition at the bottom of the contents page. This is a little abitious
           for the moment. I had too much trouble making it work with footer that's at the bottom of the page. The idea is
           being shelved for another website.</p>

        <p>The "folder" look for different categories was a novel concept to me. It uses different content bodies that
          turn invisible based on which head is active. It turned out it was possible to do so by exploiting z indices:
          the active head matches the height of the content page and act as the top of the pyramid. The heads next to it
          have their heights stepped down.<br></p>
          <p>To do this, I had to first tell javascript to change the mouse to a "pointer" to indicate the head is 
             clickable. That is, all of them except for the one that is active! Once a head is clicked, the <i>switchTab</i>
             function is done and the appropriate content page becomes visible.</p>
          <p>The illusion of height is even accentuated by my choice of shading! The active heads now simulate depth and 
          interactivity someone would feel sifting through their folder cabinet.</p>
          <p>I thought there was going to be some problems with the borders once the head and content came to
             the same level. Lucky for me, both borders dissapeared, giving way to a seamless merge of both div bodies.
