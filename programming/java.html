        <p>The program begins by presenting an incomplete sudoku board for the user. The board is randomly
           generated and the user has to continue the program to receive a solved board. If the board has multiple
           solutions, the program will find all possible answers, starting with the lowest numerical values.
        </p>
        <p> Randomizing the board always returns a board with thousands of solutions. However, the program is great when used
            as a puzzle solver. Placing a custom board as opposed to randomizing will instantly give the solved board.
            Useful for the difficult sudokus that come in the newspaper on Friday!

      <div class="s-left">
        <img id="jv-ss-img3" src="../img/jv-ss-img3.PNG" alt="img3">
        <p> To generate a random sudoku board, the program begins at the top-left corner of the board. Then it randomizes two numbers:
            <br>The <strong>emptyONum</strong> number is a chance number. If that number happens to be a 1, then it will be placed.
            Similar to a coin toss or a dice roll, the odds decrease as you increase the allowed number range.
            <br>The second number is the number that is placed in the square.
        </p>
        <p><br>If the coin toss succeeds, then it will go through the "possible" function. It will check to see if the number already 
               exists in the row, column or square. If the number already exists, then the program will act as if it failed the coin toss 
               and leave the case empty. If it is possible, the number is mapped to the random sudoku board.

      <div class="s-left">
        <img id="jv-ss-img4" src="../img/jv-ss-img4.PNG" alt="img4">
        <p>Here is what's contained in the "possible" function. It begins by checking the row and column that the parameter case belongs to.
        If it finds the parameter number already exists in the map, then the "possible" test fails.<br> 
        The third test checks the numbers that exist in the square. Since dividing integers floors the result (i.e. 5/3 = 1), you can multiply
        the result of that division to find what square the parameter case belongs to.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>Once the square is identified, it checks if the parameter number already exists in that square. If it succeeds the final test, then 
        placing the number is determined to be possible.

        <img id="jv-ss-img5" src="../img/jv-ss-img5.PNG" alt="img5">
        <p>This code is what "solves" the sudoku.<br>
        it begins at the top-left of the board checks if there's no number inside. It begins with "1", places it in the case and the function 
        is called again. If the program is no longer able to place a number, it will empty the case and backtrack to the previous instance of
        "solve".<br> This is called <strong>recursion</strong>. This cycle continues until a solution is found or until the program runs out of numbers to place.<br>
        </p>
        <p> <br>Once the cycle reaches the end of the board with a success, the number of solutions is incremented and the board is printed out.
          The process will only stop when all solutions are found, or the system is manually stopped after a solution is found.

        <p>I wanted to learn and understand how java games are made! Java games use ticks to time and update events. This one runs at 10 frames per second.
        That means the snake moves ten times every second!
        </p>
        <p>Snake games are a great way to begin developping games in any programming languages. The game is short, the rules are simple and there are many
        ways of recreating it. I decided that with every tick, the snake would move one white square in distance. A square appears in
        the direction it is heading and the last square of the line disappears. This creates the illusion of movement when, in fact, the snake is not moving at all!
        Boundaries exist as well: The program is able to calculate whether the player square has run into its tail or the walls. The game then restarts immediately, 
        but awaits user input to begin.</p>
        <p>The program uses three object classes to drive the game: <strong>Player</strong>, <strong>PlayerFollow</strong> (the tail) and <strong>Fruit</strong>.
        Player and Fruit extend the gameObject abstract class, while playerFollow extends the Player class.
        </p>

        </video> 
        <p>Next, I wanted to adapt the snake coding to make a game that was more exciting. I have a lot of good memories playing tron games with my friends, so
          I wanted to try and make a version on my own. Similar to snake, it begins with two players and awaits user input before starting.
         <p> Now, the "snakes" leave behind a permanent, laser tail. The concepts and classes are still the same as before: Run into borders, and you lose. To 
         increase fun, I added a "game end" flash when a player wins. The game is two player only!
         </p>
        </p>
        <p>This was considerably more difficult than the snake game; I'll have to approach the trail system differently so that I can increase the framerate
          and optimization. I can increase the framerate by decreasing the size of my objects, but the trail system runs poorly since too many trail objects are
          created. The problem can be solved by removing the tail objects entirely and have collision be decided on the red that is rendered on the playing field.
          How about some color too? All my games so far have been in less than 3 colors, 2 of which are technically shades.
